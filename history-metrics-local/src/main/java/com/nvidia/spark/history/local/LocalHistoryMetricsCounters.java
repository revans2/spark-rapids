 *
 * <p>Batch counters count public calls and declaration/summary status counters count returned
 * positions. {@link LocalMetricCounter#SUMMARY_ROWS} accumulates summarized observation counts.
 * Record, backend, queue-drop, and shutdown-drop counters use observation units when cardinality is
 * knowable; an uninspectable whole record call adds one
 * {@link LocalMetricCounter#RECORD_INVALID} unit. {@link LocalMetricCounter#QUEUE_CURRENT} is a gauge
 * and {@link LocalMetricCounter#QUEUE_HIGH_WATER} is its lifetime maximum. Drain and timeout results
 * count caller outcomes, while {@link LocalMetricCounter#SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE} increments once.
