/**
 * Explicitly owned, single-process driver-local history metrics implementation for conformance
 * testing and early prototypes.
 *
 * <p>{@link com.nvidia.spark.history.local.LocalHistoryMetricsFactory} requires the catalog,
 * driver clock, caller-redacted provenance source, and maximum planning age. It supplies bounded
 * implementation defaults for queues, batching, planning execution, and failure isolation. The
 * embedding plugin owns provider selection, configuration, installation, persistence, and lifecycle;
 * heuristic developers do not tune those mechanisms. Plain open performs no file access and does not
 * install the returned store in the process locator. The owner must call
 * {@link com.nvidia.spark.history.local.LocalHistoryMetrics#shutdown(java.time.Duration)}
 * with an explicit budget; it deliberately is not {@link java.lang.AutoCloseable}.
 *
 * <p>Recording uses bounded observation capacity and a single asynchronous FIFO writer. Admission
 * may drop optional evidence rather than block query work. Declaration and summary use bounded
 * planning execution and the provider-neutral relative timeout and positional-status contract.
 * {@link com.nvidia.spark.history.local.LocalHistoryMetricsTestHandle} exposes only immutable
 * point-in-time diagnostic snapshots and closed counter/state vocabularies; it is companion test
 * support, not portable raw read-back.
 *
 * <p>Snapshot save and restore are explicit, same-version local test-support operations using one
 * monotonic budget. Snapshot source, target, and residual temporary files contain unencrypted
 * sensitive data: callers must supply permitted dimensions and redacted provenance, protect the
 * paths, and clean residual files. Callers branch on
 * {@link com.nvidia.spark.history.local.LocalSnapshotException.Reason}, never diagnostic
 * message text. The snapshot facility is not a portable persistence or durability contract.
